- Bug fix problem of not being able to change table
- Level per channel/phase

- Think of a way to control shift and envelop in 
  the same place for all the note?

    we could have mc1 mc2
       - mc1 is for adsr
       - mc2 for adsrFreq

Increase number of pattern

Plan pattern sequence
Plan phase setup sequence

Loop mode on phase

a way save and share and load phase&pattern 
   -> from a photo resistor? lifi
         https://github.com/egzola/ESP8266-ScreenSetWifi
   -> from screen with qr code sequence
            -> could use the photoresitor to switch QR code everytime flash goes away



when we increase bmp should we then increase adsr time?
