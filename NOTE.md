# idea

May use BLE to display info (opz style :p)

- it could even send sequences over ble
- or even being usb midi bridge



- For the simple envelop we might just have a general level, attack time, substain time, realease time
    -> simple envelop might still have 4 phases, where attack level is 10-15% higher than substain level
    -> but for frequency envelop, we might have much more phase level and time
            --> the middle phases should a same starting and endpoint, so attack end and release start level should be the same.
