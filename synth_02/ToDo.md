        -> can chain up 8 pattern, in loop or for x times
        -> use play to feed all counters at once
- click stop on pattern will stop what ever pattern is for the current tone
- slide pattern

- should be able to change tone level from pattern?
- improve loading time by reading dir...

- should it be possible to play pattern right away, without to mwait for the next chain?
